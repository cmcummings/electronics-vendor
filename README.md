## The Website

This website was a part of the final project for CS 425: Database Organization at IIT. I worked with two other students: Andrew Cordell and Piotr Pietrzyk.

The electronics vendor website is a full stack web application using React.js, Express.js, and an SQL database. The website also makes use of Bootstrap CSS styles.

Users sign up using their email address and view their purchase history using this account. Users can view a list of all products available from the store or search for specific products by using the search bar. Users can make purchases by filling out a form.


## My Contributions
In this project, I...
- Wrote SQL queries to efficiently retrieve data from an Oracle database.
- Developed an API with Express that the front end uses to retrieve data.
- Created dynamic web pages using React.
